  <section>
    <h2>About These Projects</h2>
    <p>
      This page highlights a collection of personal projects and professional
      experiences developed both inside and outside of formal coursework.
      Together, they reflect an interest in practical problem-solving,
      system design, and learning through hands-on development.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many of these projects were driven by personal curiosity and a desire
      to build tools that could simplify everyday tasks or provide flexible
      solutions when needed. Rather than building solely for assignments,
      I focused on creating applications that were usable, adaptable, and
      grounded in real-world scenarios.
    </p>

    <p>
      Collectively, these experiences demonstrate independent learning,
      iterative development, and the ability to translate ideas into
      functional systems.
