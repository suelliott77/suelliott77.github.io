    <h2>About These Projects</h2>
    <p>
    This page highlights a collection of smaller personal projects and experiments
    developed outside of formal coursework. Each project reflects an interest in
    practical problem-solving, system design, and hands-on learning through
    building real, usable tools.
    </p>

    <p>
    Many of these projects were driven by personal curiosity and a desire to
    explore how software can simplify everyday tasks. Rather than building for
    assignments alone, I created tools that I could realistically use to make my
    own life a little easier or give myself flexible options when solving common
    problems.
    </p>

    <p>
    Through these projects, I focused on translating ideas into working systems,
    experimenting with different approaches, and refining implementations through
    iteration. Collectively, they demonstrate a willingness to learn independently,
    explore new concepts, and apply technical skills in practical, real-world
    contexts.
