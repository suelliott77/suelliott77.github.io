  <!-- ABOUT -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
   <p>
    I am a Computer Engineering student at Texas A&M University graduating in May 2026,
    with a strong foundation in software development, databases, and emerging AI technologies.
    Alongside my technical education, I place a high value on serving and leading people.
    Through roles at Camp Eagle and within First Baptist Church in Bryan, I have worked closely
    with students and peers in mentorship and leadership positions, developing communication,
    empathy, and accountability. I believe effective engineering is not just about building
    systems, but about understanding and supporting the people who use them.

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Group Camp Counselor — Camp Eagle</h3>
      <p><em>May 2023 - Aug 2025</em></p>
      <ul>
        Over three summers at Camp Eagle, I served as a Group Camp Counselor, 
        leading middle and high school students through outdoor adventures that 
        supported the camp's mission of Christ-like change through outdoor 
        adventure, authentic relationships, and biblical truth. I facilitated 
        high-energy activities such as rock climbing, hiking, and team challenges, 
        while also guiding small-group discussions and devotionals to encourage 
        spiritual growth. I learned to embrace flexibility and adaptability in 
        meeting each group's unique needs, ensuring a safe, engaging, and meaningful 
        experience for every camper. This role strengthened my leadership, conflict 
        resolution, and discipleship skills within a dynamic, faith-centered environment.
