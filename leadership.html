    <h2>Leadership Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Leadership, to me, is rooted in service, adaptability, and intentional
      relationships. Through faith-based environments and mentoring roles,
      I have learned that effective leadership often means meeting people
      where they are and remaining flexible in order to guide, support,
      and challenge others well.
